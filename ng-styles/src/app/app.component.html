<!-- 
  When using ngStyle , you have a choice regarding the style of your CSS property names.

You can use ngStyle  like this: [ngStyle]="{'background-color': 'red'}" 

This works fine and there's nothing wrong with it. You have to make sure to enclose background-color  in single quotation 
marks since it otherwise would be an invalid JavaScript property name (keep in mind: it's used as a property in the object you pass to ngStyle !).

You may use the JavaScript version of this CSS property as an alternative: [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: 'red'}" 

This syntax is available for all CSS properties which would be invalid JS properties otherwise.

Feel free to use whichever you prefer!
